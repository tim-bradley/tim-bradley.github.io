  <h2>I like ... stuff!</h2>
<p>This is a test page for a blog I want to create about law, code, health, and other topics I like.</p>
<p>The intention is to use the blog to write about stuff I find interesting, 
and in so doing learn about git, github, Jekyll and other "stuff".</p>
<p>More will come ... unless I get distracted by that butterfly....</p>
